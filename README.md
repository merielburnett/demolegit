WIP project using ALC embeddings to observe changes in sentiment toward democracy over time

### hreq.py 
this script scrapes the URLs of threads with "/ptg/" in the title from archived.moe 


### hreqdumper.py
this script takes the json with URLs generated by hreq.py, accesses each thread, and scrapes post text and metadata


### dumptocsv.py
this script takes the json generated from hreqdumper.py, cleans it very slightly, and converts it to a csv 


### ptgALClocal.R
this R script takes a csv with 4chan posts, processes it using quanteda, generates ALC embeddings using conText, computes a 'Support/Opposition' axis, then calculates cosine between a TARGETWORD and the 'Support' end of this axis for each yearweek segment of the data. note: needs updating, does not currently work with the 'scraped_thread_data.csv' created by dumptocsv.py
